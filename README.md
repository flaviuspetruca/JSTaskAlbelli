## _What the code does_

Requires a natural number greater than 0 adn smaller than 10000 to be inputed.
Will display for each number in the interval 1 to n (number typed in the input) 
- foo bar if the number is divisible by 2 and 3
- foo if the number is divisible just by 2
- bar if the number is divisible just by 3
- and the iterration number in the other case.

# Task
* Input a positive number.
* Print out the numbers starting with 1.
* But if a number is dividable by 2 print out “foo”.
* If a number is dividable by 3 print out “bar”.
